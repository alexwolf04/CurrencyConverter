# Java Currency Converter 💱

This was my first Java project — a simple yet functional **currency converter** application built using Java and NetBeans. The goal was to help users convert between multiple currencies in real time, while getting hands-on experience with Java Swing, basic logic, and GUI design.

## 🌍 Supported Currencies
The converter includes support for ~10 common world currencies:

- USD – US Dollar  
- EUR – Euro  
- GBP – British Pound  
- JPY – Japanese Yen  
- CAD – Canadian Dollar  
- AUD – Australian Dollar  
- CHF – Swiss Franc  
- INR – Indian Rupee  
- CNY – Chinese Yuan  
- MXN – Mexican Peso  

(*Note: exchange rates are hardcoded or based on preset values for learning purposes.*)

## 🧰 Built With
- **Java SE**  
- **NetBeans IDE**  
- **Swing GUI Toolkit**  
- No external libraries used — pure Java code.

## 🖥️ Features
- Simple GUI for selecting input/output currencies  
- Field for entering an amount  
- Converts between selected currencies instantly  
- Clear & Reset functionality  
- Beginner-friendly structure and easy to expand

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open this project in **NetBeans**.
2. Build the project (Clean & Build or press `F11`).
3. Run the project (`Shift + F6`).
4. Use the interface to convert between currencies.

## 📚 What I Learned
- Building GUIs with Java Swing
- Handling events (button clicks, combo boxes)
- Managing user input and output
- Understanding basic application structure in Java
- How to organize and push code to GitHub 🚀

## 🧠 Future Improvements
- Live exchange rate API integration (like from [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/))
- Dark mode theme toggle
- Currency symbols formatting
- Save last used settings
